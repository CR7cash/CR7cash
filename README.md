- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, we are @CR7cash


We are proud to announce a step forward for the crypto world: the CR7 Token (CR7). CR7 Token is a fan token made for the Greatest of All Times (GOAT). CR7 Token will pave the way for the wide acceptance of cryptos and promote their useability and use-cases. The CR7 Token pays tribute to the GOAT and fosters wide crypto assets acceptance! CR7 Token is a very scarce fan token, with a total supply of only 1.14 billion units. The voracious appetite of CR7 fans in having it will demonstrate to a general audience that crypto-fans want to HOLD! Since it is scarce, people will want to have it. Since it is for fans, people will love to have it. Since transactions are on-chain, CR7 Tokens can keep track of token ownership, marking new feats and milestones achieved by the CR7 and its fans.


THE PURPOSES

CR7 Token (CR7) has three purposes intended to be achieved by the community of Holders of the fan Token. 

Purpose one: to pay tribute to Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro (Cristiano, Ronaldo or Cristiano Ronaldo). The project wants to honor Ronaldo's achievements during his playing days at club level and on the worldwide stage representing Portugal national team - without him, football may have never become what it's now known around the world today.

Purpose two: demonstrate the possible broad adoption of CR7 crypto tokens by a massive community unfamiliar with the concept and portray the decentralized governance power of a crypto ecosystem. Many of Cristiano's fans are, up until now, unfamiliar with crypto assets. A crypto-asset aiming at celebrating a sports GOAT is a concept easy to understand. Every fan of sports has had the opportunity of having an album and a sticker collection of their favorite teams and players. Why not HOLDing CR7 instead?

Purpose three: Bring innovation on social networks workflow, creating a new type of Token that will allow people from all over the world to share the same interest in their favorite celebrity (CR7). It is an ample opportunity for more engagement than they would typically experience through traditional social media channels.

WHY CR7?

The crypto world has been lacking a proper celebrity engagement. While institutions, including football clubs, have brought forward crypto initiatives, the linkage of a crypto asset with an individual celebrity was missing until this moment. Therefore, we have created a crypto token dedicated to Cristiano Ronaldo, a globally recognized athlete. He has been seen as a leader in the sports and entertainment industry for years. Ronaldo will significantly impact the crypto industry by introducing it to his massive fans â€“ a new group of potential users. CR7 is the obvious choice for promoting the Token since he is the GOAT. The use of the Token is a tribute to his legacy and his philanthropic vision.

WHY CRYPTO?

Adopting the CR7 Token can represent that the owner is either a fan of CR7, crypto - or both. The wide use of CR7 Token and the development of its community will promote crypto awareness and differentiation of its use cases. By demonstrating the wide adoption of the CR7 Tokens, crypto tokens will end the eternal debate of their use as valuable means of exchange and fulfill people's dreams, ambitions, and financial liberation.

Owners control where their Tokens go. They do this by using a technology that is open to everyone worldwide, dispensing with minimum maintenance and operative fees without needing a traditional bank. As a result, CR7 fans will be pioneers and understand that they can transfer tokens between themselves, guaranteeing an understanding of the concept of crypto assets. But, of course, the same thing that can happen with CR7 Tokens can also occur with other crypto assets, such as assets that can be used as means of exchange or represent money. The Team's purpose is to seamlessly prove that crypto tokens can be sent back and forth worldwide by every human being. In addition, the possibility of simple cross-border transfer of fees is portrayed to all the adopters, available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. 

                                                                  Join us â€“ Be a GOATionary!

ECOSYSTEM

WHAT DO the CR7 Token (CR7) roadmap and its community mean to achieve these purposes? The GOAT paper will now elaborate on ecosystem and architecture. As of now, 1.140.000.000 CR7 Token (CR7) are available and rendered on DEX exchanges. CR7 Token Team plans no further issuance of CR7 Token (CR7). Of these Tokens, 5% are on a cold wallet, which the Team and the community consider a tribute to CR7. If the GOAT acknowledges our praise by publicly and verifiably saluting his HOLDer fans on social networks, the Team will directly send the GOAT wallet to him. How awesome would it be? Wouldn't this happen? If our GOAT does not salute us, these treasury tokens will be released deflated to the DEX exchanges for fans collection. While CR7.cash Team mint the CR7 Token, the disposal and loading on the DEXexchanges determine its governance model since the CR7.cash Team has already renounced the ownership of the Token by relinquishing the possibility of further burning, minting, or changing its fundamental status. The decentralization of the CR7 Tokenecosystem has a second layer of security, community participation. The Team is aiming at creating a community full of vibrant members. These members will be able and willing to produce NFTs minted and accessible only to those who HOLD CR7 Tokens! The holders will also participate in the decision-making process of the CR7.project by accessing an off-chain community available only to those who HODL.

                                                                    Remember, be a GOAT!
